The task of the challenge is to discover novel objects in a large corpus of unlabeled images using knowledge about known objects. Specifically, given a labeled dataset with K known
objects and a large unlabeled dataset consisting of U (not known a-priori) unknown objects,  algorithms should output a set of M (not known a-priori) clusters, each of which contains
regions belonging to an object class. Additionally, an object detector should be trained for each cluster whose performance is evaluated on a held-out set to assess the real world
applicability of the object discovery system.</p>

The primary evaluation metric is the Area under the curve of Purity coverage plots and PASCAL VOC style mean Average Precision at an IoU threshold of 0.50. Additionally we also
    report the number of clusters, number of objects discovered, Correct Localization. </p>
